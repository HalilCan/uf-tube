# uf-tube
## 1. What
uf-tube is a YouTube clone built primarily on PHP with a MySQL database. 

In its next iteration, I aim to make a decentralized version.

### 1.a. Current State
uf-tube allows for account activity (sign up, sign in), uploading videos, viewing videos, subscriptions, likes, comment chains...: A long list adding up to what is superficially the functionality of contemporary YouTube.

Editing videos, managing playlists, and complex profile pages are missing functionality. This does not include big data functionality such as complex recommendations,  profiling, automatic playlist formation etc. While those problems sound interesting, it would be better to tackle them in a more abstract manner in another project, given I do not have the data.

## 2. Why
It was an interesting exercise in seeing extremely common patterns in web design (at both ends) and a way to implement them.
